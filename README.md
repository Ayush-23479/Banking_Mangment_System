🏦 Banking Management System 💳

The Banking Management System is an intermediate Java backend project that uses JDBC and MySQL to handle various banking operations such as account management, transactions, and balance inquiries. Here’s a brief description of its core components and functionalities:
Core Components:

    Account Class 💼:
        Attributes: Account number, account holder name, balance, and account type.
        Methods:
            createAccount(): Creates a new account.
            deposit(): Deposits money into the account.
            withdraw(): Withdraws money from the account.
            getBalance(): Retrieves the current balance.

    Database Connection 🔗:
        Purpose: Manages the connection to the MySQL database using JDBC.
        Implementation: Establishes and closes the connection to the database.

    AccountDAO Class 💾:
        Attributes: Database connection.
        Methods:
            addAccount(Account account): Adds a new account to the database.
            updateAccount(Account account): Updates account details in the database.
            deleteAccount(int accountNumber): Deletes an account from the database.
            getAccount(int accountNumber): Retrieves account details from the database.

    Transaction Class 💸:
        Attributes: Transaction ID, account number, transaction type, amount, date.
        Methods:
            recordTransaction(): Records a transaction in the database.

    Main Class 🚀:
        Methods:
            main(String[] args): The entry point of the application. It handles user interactions and invokes methods for various operations.


Workflow :

    Establish Database Connection:
        The DatabaseConnection class connects to the MySQL database using JDBC.

    Create and Add Account:
        The AccountDAO class uses SQL statements to add new accounts to the database.

    Retrieve Account Details:
        The AccountDAO class fetches account details from the database using SQL queries.

    Update and Delete Accounts:
        The AccountDAO class provides methods to update and delete accounts using SQL operations.

Key Features:

    Data Persistence: Utilizes MySQL to store and manage data.
    Database Operations: Handles CRUD operations using JDBC.
    Account Management: Manages account creation, updating, and deletion.
    Transaction Management: Records and manages transactions for accounts.

This system effectively manages banking operations using intermediate Java skills with JDBC for database interactions, providing a solid backend solution for banking management. 🏦🚀
